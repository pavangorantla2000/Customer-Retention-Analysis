## Background

The Customer Retention Analysis project aims to analyze customer churn within the last month. It involves examining various factors such as services signed up for, customer account information, and demographic details to identify key insights that can help improve customer retention.

## Features

- Analyze services each customer has signed up for, including phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies.
- Consider customer account information such as tenure, contract type, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, total charges, and the number of tickets opened in administrative and technical categories.
- Utilize demographic information like gender, age range, and whether customers have partners and dependents.

## Task

The main tasks of this project are as follows:

1. Define Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that will be used to measure customer retention and identify areas for improvement.
2. Create a dynamic and intuitive dashboard that reflects the defined KPIs.
3. Provide slicers to allow easy filtering and analysis of the KPIs for different customer segments, including churned and non-churned customers.

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard for the Customer Retention Analysis project is designed to provide a comprehensive view of customer information, account details, and service usage. The page is divided into three main sections:

1. **Customer Information**: This section displays demographic details about the customers, including gender, age range, and whether they have partners and dependents.

2. **Account Information**: Here, you can find customer account-related data such as tenure, contract type, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, total charges, and the number of tickets opened in administrative and technical categories.

3. **Service Information**: This section presents information about the services each customer has signed up for, including phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies.

The dashboard includes slicers that allow you to analyze the KPIs for specific segments of customers. By using these slicers, you can easily compare churned and non-churned customers and gain valuable insights for customer retention strategies.
